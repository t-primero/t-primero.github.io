## What I'm Looking For

## What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking **full-time data analyst and data scientist roles** starting May 2026 (upon graduation). I'm particularly interested in positions that emphasize exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, and translating complex datasets into actionable business insights—especially within marketing analytics or research-focused teams.

I'm also open to:

- **Networking conversations** with data professionals about career paths and industry trends
- **Collaborative projects** involving data mining, machine learning, or predictive modeling
- **Informational interviews** at companies tackling interesting data challenges

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss opportunities, grab coffee (virtual or in-person), or connect about all things data!
